# Raw_Image_Converter
Greetings! 

I am excited to introduce you to the Raw_Image_Converter project which can efficiently convert your .nef/.NEF image files to .jpg format by using the terminal.  

As a photographer, you may have come across the need to convert your files for sharing or uploading purposes. With this project, you can now do so with just a few clicks.

To utilize this user-friendly project, clone the repository or download the script to your directory which contains all .NEF/.nef files, and install the necessary dependencies. 

* FYI, install Python first from [their official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt    
```
```
cd /your_nef_files_folder
```

Once completed, run the script, and it will automatically select all .nef files under the same directory you want to convert and save them in a **JPG_files** folder. It will list all .nef files in your terminal and show current_process/total_number.

```
python3 raw_image_convertor.py
```

Its ability to convert multiple files simultaneously and handle all the technical work for you makes it a reliable choice.

Furthermore, I have included error handling to ensure the conversion process runs smoothly. If you have any suggestions for improvement or encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to leave a comment. I am always eager to enhance my projects and provide better service.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. I hope it will prove to be an invaluable tool for you!
